# Codex xegos 

## Installation

Put your OAI key in `.env`

## Create a New xego

To create a new xego run `npm run n-xego -command | --c "your command here" --name "your-xego-name"`

This will create a file in your directory called `{command}.js`

For more complex xegos, you can pass in other xegos as arguments from a file. Post them in order. 
For example `npm run n-xego -command | --c "your command here" --xegos xego.txt`

## Edit your xego

## Combine xegos

To compose xegos, you can import them as you would any other JS file.

## Send your xego to GitHub Gist or Repl.it

1. comment in top of file? (problem with formatting -- what if its deleted)
2. metadata in file? 
3. JSON in neighboring file? (problem with editing -- how do I store it?)
