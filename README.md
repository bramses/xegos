# Codex Legos 

## Installation

Put your OAI key in `.env`


## Create a New Lego

To create a new lego run `npm run n-lego -command | --c "your command here"`

This will create a file in your directory called `{command}.js`

For more complex legos, you can pass in other legos as arguments from a file. Post them in order. 
For example `npm run n-lego -command | --c "your command here" --legos lego.txt`

## Edit your Lego

## Combine Legos

To compose legos, you can import them as you would any other JS file.

## Send your Lego to GitHub Gist
